<h1>Who I Am and What I Do</h1>
<p align="justify"> Hi, i'm glad you're here! Based in Vienna, i mainly focus on Web-Development & Cyber Security. I like to fiddle around with languages like ZIG, Go or sometimes some Rust and also get hands on "close to the hardware" topics.

I'm look forward to any kind of exchange. Feel free to reach out, and we can chat on Discord about the wonderful world of information technology! 

**One important note:**
Access to technology should be a given for everyone, but unfortunately, it is not. It is unevenly distributed and, despite its central importance, still not freely accessible. Our data is being collected daily, even now, often without our knowledge or consent, raising critical concerns about privacy and security.</p>
<p>We must advocate for transparency and control over how our information is used!</p>
<p>Get organized!</p>
